							<p class="MsoNormal">If adolescents are affected by 
							the media that they are exposed to, it becomes 
							important to take a look at how the portrayal of 
							gender roles has changed in the consumed media. If 
							the message changes, the effect on the adolescent 
							will also change. <o:p></o:p></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">We first looked at the gender 
							representations in commercials. Although adolescents 
							(or adults for that matter) do not generally watch 
							television for the advertisements, they are a large 
							part of what is seen while watching TV. A study by 
							Lynn T. Lovdal in 1989 wanted to find out how sex 
							roles had changed in commercials in the previous ten 
							years. She found that the ads were very heavily 
							stereotyped – likely to show males in dominant 
							positions, or women doing household work, even 
							though at the time women comprised the larger part 
							of the workforce (54.6%). However, although 
							stereotyping was present, ads were less likely to 
							show people in stereotypical roles than in the 
							1970s. For instance, in 1978 women were product 
							representatives for 86% of domestic products (food, 
							household supplies, etc.) whereas ten years later 
							this number had shrank to 55%. <o:p></o:p></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">But how have these numbers 
							changed since then? The most recent update to this 
							study was done in 200 by Bartsch and Barnett. In 
							their study, they state that gender stereotyping is 
							worse than it had been ten years prior. However, it 
							is worse noting that commercials had begun to shy 
							away from having a primary product representative, 
							so the methods used were less able to deal with the 
							commercials than before. Also, the number of 
							advertisements with women doing the voiceover 
							increased from about 10% to 30%.
							<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>This data 
							shows that the amount of stereotypical gender roles 
							has greatly decreased since the late 70s but 
							slightly increased since the late 80s.<o:p></o:p></p>
							<hr>
							<p class="MsoNormal">What about other types of 
							media? <o:p></o:p></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">Although the stereotypical 
							gender representation has gone down in commercials 
							since the 1970s, the same cannot be said about 
							cartoons. In the study “Gender Roles in Animated 
							Cartoons: Has the Picture Changed in 20 Years?” 
							Thompson and Zerbinos argue that although there are 
							less stereotypical characters in cartoons than in 
							the 1970s, the great majority of characters are in 
							stereotypical gender roles. The majority of cartoon 
							characters are males that are dominant and 
							aggressive. <o:p></o:p></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">Video games can’t really be 
							compared to the past since video games with decent 
							graphics (i.e. photorealism) and complex storylines 
							haven’t been along as other types of media. However, 
							the portrayal of men and women in video games shows 
							men as aggressive and stereotypically manly while 
							objectifying women. However, in a study by Dill and 
							Thill, it is mentioned that the methods of measuring 
							the gender stereotyping in video games is flawed and 
							might be wrong since the majority of gamers argue 
							that gender stereotyping in video games has negative 
							effects.<o:p></o:p></p>
							<hr>
							<p class="MsoNormal">Results:<o:p></o:p></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">Gender stereotypes are 
							definitely present in the media that adolescents 
							consume. Although it may be in lesser amounts than 
							before (i.e. the 1970s), it is still an issue since 
							the children that consume this media learn 
							“stereotyped patterns for both genders and have more 
							strongly sex typed attitudes” than their peers that 
							do not (Lovdal 722).<o:p></o:p></p>
