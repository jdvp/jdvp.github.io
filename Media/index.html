									<p>
										As an adolescent develops, they come into contact with many 
										external stimuli that affect the ways 
										that they think and act. These outside 
										influences include friends, family, 
										teachers, religious leaders. However, 
										these influences don't have to be people 
										and can also include various forms of media and social media as it becomes increasingly prolific and easier to access. We sought out 
the effects that media has on adolescents' psycho-social development and had many questions that we wanted to answer. 

									</p>
									<p>
										How has an increased use of social media 
										affected adolescent development? Does 
										playing video games make adolescents 
										more aggressive? How do gender 
										represenations in media affect the 
										behavior of adolescents? If there are 
										negative effects of any of the various 
										types of media, are there any 
										organizations trying to combat these 
										negative effects? For an answer to any 
										of these questions, navigate to a 
										specific page using the buttons at the 
										left.</p>
