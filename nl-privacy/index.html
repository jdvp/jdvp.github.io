            <h1>Notification Launcher Privacy Policy - Android</h1>
            <h4>Effective: November 13, 2018</h4>
            <p>Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect and how we use the collected information. For more detailed information or explanations, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:valentechsoftware@gmail.com">valentechsoftware@gmail.com</a></p>
            <h3>Information Collected</h3>
            <p>As of the effective date listed above, Notifcation Launcher uses 2 Android Permission : RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED and INTERNET. Neither of these is used to collect or store personally identifiable user information. <br><br>The RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED permission is used to reschedule notifications that the user has previously scheduled after the user's device has been restarted. This permission notifies the Notification Launcher application that the device has been restarted but that is all of the information the app receives that is not manually input into the app by the user. Information entered by the user (including, but not limited to, notification title, notifaction message, and notification scheduled timing) never leaves the device. A small amount of other data is collected in the normal usage of the app, including the installed applications on the user's Android device, which is necessary to the core functionality of the application. This information also never leaves the user's device. <br><br>The INTERNET permission is used to retrieve tutorial data but makes a GET service call that does not send any data to a server. If the internet permission is revoked, the tutorial feature may stop working but everything else will work as intended. If the user has previously viewed the tutorials, the cached tutorial data should remain available even if the permission is denied by the user but new tutorials will not be able to be downloaded.In the future this permission may be used to serve both personalized and non-personalized ads based on the user's disgression.</p>
            <h3>Information Received</h3>
            <p>Even though the app uses the INTERNET permission, it does not send user data off of the device. No analytics or crash reporting libraries are used so no data is collected except for the anonymized crash data that the Google Play Store collects automatically for all apps.</p>
            <p>If the end-user is still wary about providing the INTERNET permission to the Notificaton Launcher application, they can opt to turn off the INTERNET permission entirely and all core functionality will still work as intended. </p>
            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p>Changes to the apps permissions and behaviors will be reflected in this policy as updates as soon as necessary (i.e. when a change is made in the Notification Launcher application). For changelogs related to Notification Launcher, see the <a href="https://jdvp.me/nl-release-notes/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
