				<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
				<p>
					I'm currently employed as a professional Android Developer. Although I'm a Texas native,
					I've been living out of state since I graduated from college. I've lived in Columbus, Ohio 
					for the past 5 years but am excited to be moving to Seattle in the near future.
					<br>
					<br>
					Immediately after graduating from Rice University, I was employed at JP Morgan working on 
					their Chase Pay mobile application. I helped shape its initial public release in November 2016 
					and continued work on it until its 2.0 release.
					<br>
					<br>
					At that point, I moved over to L Brands and focused my work on the PINK Nation and Victoria's Secret Android apps,
					although I had to work on the Bath & Body Works app on occasion. My primary focus at L Brands was leading Android 
					development on an internal Shopping library that powered the shopping experinece in both the VS and PINK applications.
					<br>
					<br>
					As of May 2021, I am working at Zillow as a Senior SDE. I am excited for the opportunity
					and hope that my retail knowledge transfers over!
					<br>
					<br>
					For more detailed information on my professional experiences, take a look at my profile on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdporterfield/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>!

				<h2>Articles</h2>
				<p>
					I have recently been trying to write more articles, mostly on programming and programming-related topics. If you are interested in reading them, please check them out at <a href="https://jdvp.me/articles/" target="_blank">https://jdvp.me/articles/</a>. I usually write about Android topics since I have more experience there than elsewhere but would like to branch out more into other topics in which I am more of a hobbyist, such as Jekyll or scripting on a NAS.
					<br>
					<br>
					I have set up commenting on the articles so please feel free to ask any questions or leave any feedback (even just on writing style if you'd like). The site should also work with atom-readers if you'd prefer to keep up-to-date that way.

				<h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
				<p>
					My interests include mobile development, which explains my day job, and web development
					which I do as more of a hobby. I don't keep up with web frameworks since (from my perspective)
					they seem to change so fast and I go long stretches of time without doing web apps. I think it
					would also be really cool to do video game programming but to be honest, I'm not sure entirely
					what that entails!
					<br>
					<br>
					When I'm not programming, I like to try to stay active by hiking and visiting the Metro Parks
					that Columbus has to offer. Since I'm stuck in a cubicle for hours every day, I try to make
					it to the gym as often as I can.
					<br>
					<br>
					I also really like watching anime and playing video games! I really enjoy RPGs and some of my
					favorite games I've played lately include Nier: Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Persona 5. I won
					a Nintendo Switch in an arcade game (it's possible!) and have been playing it pretty often. If you
					need game or anime recommendations, let me know!
