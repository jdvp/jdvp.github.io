                        word?
                    </h2>
                <p>Statistexts is an Android application that allows you
                    to see exactly how responsive your friends are. The app
                    gathers statistics about your text messages, hence
                    Statistexts. The app analyzes all of the text messages
                    on your phone and allows you to see how your friends
                    rank in comparison to each other over many different
                    statistics including Fastest to Reply, Most Positive,
                    Slowest to Reply, and many more. You can find features
                    of the Statistext application listed below!

                                &nbsp;Upon opening the app, your messages will be loaded and
                                this will be the screen that you see. The loading of messsages
                                should be quick on subsequent opens of the app since they can be analyzed
                                as you get messages. On the main screen, your contacts are ordered
                                by a number of metrics - the default is to sort your friends based
                                on how fast they reply to your messages.

                                You can choose to order your friends in a number of ways from
                                how fast they respond to how positive they are generally in
                                messages. You can order them in both ascending and descending
                                order. For every metric, you can also rank your contacts in
                                relation to yourself. E.g. You can sort your friends by who
                                YOU reply to most quickly.

                                that relates how the contact's response time
                                has changed over time. These graphs are
                                generated by Google Graphs and therefore you

                                The settings page has a few useful items. One of these is the
                                ability to erase stored data, which can be used in case you want
                                to clear data and reanalyze messages (in case you have deleted
                                a bunch etc.). Another useful feature is to be able to change
                                the 'conversation timeout' which is the time that it takes before
                                a message is considered an entirely new conversation rather than
                                a reply. Finally, you can unhide contacts that you may have
                                chosen to hide on the main page (done by long pressing an item).

                                I am constantly trying to update the app and add cool features.
                                For instance, the above screenshot shows app shortcuts available
                                for Statistexts on Android 7.1. If you have any suggestions or
                                ideas, be sure to look up my most recent contact info on
                                <a href="http://jdvp.me">my personal website</a>. I will try my

                <p>As of January 8, 2019, Statistexts has been unpublished from the Google Play store due to issues listed on my Medium article <a href="https://medium.com/@jdvp/so-long-statistexts-7e7ebdb3ef18" target="_blank">found here</a>. A non-functional copy of the last version of the play store listing can be <a href="play-store-listing/index.htm" target="_blank">found here</a>. I will publish any updates directly to this page (at least for the time being). Below you can find both the Google Play signed apk (which is the latest version that was available on Google Play) and the most recent version that isn't signed by Google Play. Updating from the Play Store version will require you to uninstall the app first since I had been previously using Google's app signing to sign the apk.
