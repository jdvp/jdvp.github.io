Statistexts Website
	Website designed to show the features of the Statistexts Android application.
	
	All content and images created by JD Porterfield.
		Updates from time to time to reflect addition of new features, etc.
		
	Template used currently but might create my own in the future.
		Nor sure whether I want to angularize the whole thing, etc.
		Will work on this over Winter Break 2015
			The goal will to be turn this into a (good-looking) angular application which will:
				Help make content look more uniform
				Save space (ideally) by removing a lot of unnessecary files in that are currently in the hierarchical structure of this website currently
