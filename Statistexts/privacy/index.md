# Statistexts Privacy Policy

###### Effective: February 2, 2017

Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect and how we use the collected information. For more detailed information or explanations, feel free to contact us at [valentechsoftware@gmail.com](mailto:valentechsoftware@gmail.com)

### Information Collected

Statistexts has multiple permissions that collect user information. However, the majority of them are used to collect data in the app for routine processing of data on the device itself without results ever being sent off of the device. These permissions include READ_SMS, READ_CONTACTS, and RECEIVE_SMS. Since the Statistexts application is used to display analysis of text message data to users, READ_SMS and READ_CONTACTS are necessary. To be clear, however, SMS and Contact data never leave the device. RECIEVE_SMS is less important and is only used to parse information as the end-user receives text messages so that boot-time of the app is quicker. As stated before, SMS data that this permission gives access to do not ever leave the device.

### Information Received

Statistexts does recieve anonymous data using the INTERNET permission through Google Firebase in order to track how many users the app has in a given time frame and how popular certain features are. For instance, clicking on the analyze text messages button sends us data so that we can see what the follow through rate is for for flows such as opening the app and navigating to the contacts screen. This data CANNOT be used to identify individual users and is not given in any shape or form by us to any other entities and is used to provide better services in the app (knowing which features are the most used will help us determine which new features to develop). The internet permission also allows the app to display ads to the user.

If the end-user is not satisfied by the behaviour of the app in sending the anonymized data and recieving ads, they can opt to turn off the INTERNET permission entirely and the app will work as intended still.

### Changes

Changes to the apps permissions and behaviors will be reflected in this policy as updates as soon as necessary (i.e. when a change is made in the Statistexts application).
