						<h2>RHApp is an incredibly life chanigng health app for 
						Rice students by Rice students.</h2>
						<p>Have you ever been really sick and didn't want to 
						walk all the way to your local RHA's room only to find 
						out that they weren't there? Have you ever really needed 
						condoms RIGHT NOW and there were no available RHA's 
						ANYWHERE? Have you ever been a Hanszenite hanging out at 
						Martel and you felt like you needed a little medication 
						in your life but you didn't know any of the RHAs at 
						Martel so you had to either choose to walk all the way 
						back to your college or suffer the pains of the world?<br>
						Well this is the app for you.</p>

									of Rice students. Notice that in keeping 
									with our health theme, the owl's eyes are

									kidding, of course. However, this sorting is 
									useful if you are at a college that you 
									don't live at and are unfamiliar with the

						<h2>Specific Actions</h2>
						<p>You might be wondering what some specific things are 
						that you can accomplish with RHApp. Currently, you can 
						acquire health supplies, including condoms, send 
						questions to and locate RHAs, find out which RHAs are 
						available and which available RHAs actually have the 
						supplies you need. RHAs can log into the app to answer 
						any questions and let other users know if they have the 
						specific items that are needed. You can even use this 
						app to become closer friends with an RHA! Truth be told, 
						the possibilities are limitless.</p>

									<h3>Meet the developers.</h3>
									<p>RHApp started as a HackRice project in 
									early 2015. However, it grew into something 
									greater. The team developing the project 
									realized the profound effect the app could 
									have on the university and student body in 
									the future. Although the application hadn't 
									been ready to present to the judges at the 
									hackathon, the team decided to finish the 
									project, allowing it to flourish into what 
									it is today.</p>
									<p>The developers have a wide range of 
									experience and are dedicated to updating 
									RHApp well into the future, to further fit 
									the students' needs.</p>
