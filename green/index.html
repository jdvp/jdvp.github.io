				<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
				<p>
					I'm currently employed as a professional Android Developer. Although I'm a Texas native,
					I've been living and working in Columbus, Ohio since I graduated from college.
					<br>
					<br>
					I work at L Brands and focus my work on the PINK Nation and Victoria's Secret Android apps,
					although I have had to work on the Bath & Body Works app on occasion.
					<br>
					<br>
					Previously, I had been employed at JP Morgan working on their Chase Pay mobile application.
					I helped shape its initial public release in November 2016 and continued work on it
					until its 2.0 release.

				<h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
				<p>
					My interests include Mobile Development, which explains my day job, and Web Development,
					which I do as more of a hobby.
					<br>
					<br>
					When I'm not programming, I like to try to stay active by hiking and visiting all of the Metro Parks
					that Columbus has to offer. Since I'm stuck in a cubicle for hours every day, I also try to make
					it to the gym as often as I can.
					<br>
					<br>
					I also really like watching anime and playing video games! I really enjoy RPGs and some of my
					favorite games I've played lately include Nier Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Persona 5. I won
					a Nintendo Switch in an arcade game (it's possible!) and have been playing it pretty often.
