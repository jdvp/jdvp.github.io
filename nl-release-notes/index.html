                            <p>Release notes for the Notification Launcher app found on Google Play : <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.jdvp.notificationlauncher" target="_blank">Notification Launcher</a></p>
                                <b>2.4.0</b>
                                <br>March 15, 2020
                                <li>Added a Launch Screen that shows instead of the initial blank-white screen that shows for a second at app start-up.</li> 
                                <li>Speeds up the time that is required for the app list to be loaded on the main screen. Ideally, now the loader should not be shown except in circumstances where multiple hundreds of apps are installed.</li> 
                                <li>Updated ProGuard Obfuscation Rules to decrease app size. 2.15MB -> 1.77MB</li> 
                                <li>Chore : Updated dependencies to ingest any fixes they had made.</li> 
                                <li>Fixed an obscure crash that never seemed to happen to anyone other than me (didn't see it in the prod logs).</li> 
                                <li>Adds a fade to replace the jarring transition when changing to/from the dark theme.</li>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>2.3.0</b>
                                <br>April 10, 2019 
                                <li>Adds the ability to hide apps on the main screen (and unhide them in the settings menu).</li>
                                <li>Updates the organization of data in the app. In the long term, this should lead to less storage used by the app. Sorry if this causes any weird upgrade issues! On a more technical level, the app had previously been storing all objects in SharedPreferences as JSON objects, as it was underestimated how large various objects would be in memory. Now, the app is using the Room library (which leverages SQLite) provided by Google's Android Architecture Components to store items in a database. This reduces overhead as app images can be stored in one row of a DB rather than in each notification item. Further it allows for updates on the data objects more easily in the future.</li>
                                <li>Sped up start-up time. This is a by-product of the changes I made for the above item.</li>
                                <li>Fixed crash seen when using an alarm for a deleted app. I didn't see any reports from this on user devices other than my own.</li>
                                <li>Fixed issue with Quick Notifications not actually using the correct amount of time. When creating Quick Notifications, the first time worked properly but every time after would use one-step down for the time unit (e.g. a 4 hour Quick Notification would become a 4 minute one). This is fixed but old QNs created before this update will need to be deleted in order to fix the behavior.</li>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>2.2.0 & 2.2.1</b>
                                <br>March 16, 2019 
                                <li>Adds the ability to group notifications by app in the "Past" and "Scheduled" notifications pages</li>
                                <li>Adds the ability to create notifications using the "second" time unit</li>
                                <li>Fixes an issue with recurring notifications and increases alarm accuracy. Specifically, repeating notifications did not seem to be accurate enough when using seconds. Accordingly, I've removed usages of AlarmManager's setRepeating method since it is known to be inexact. The documentation can be found <a href ="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#setRepeating(int,%20long,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)" target="_blank">here</a>. I'm now using setExact which will trigger on time but causes more battery usage potentially</li>
                                <li>Adds more support for devices in landscape mode</li>
                                <li>Adds a few animations (mostly for caret rotation)</li>
                                <li>2.2.1 hotfix specifically fix app grouping which seemingly wasn't working on a few devices</li>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>2.1.2</b>
                                <br>February 8, 2019 
                                <li>Updated some text to make instructions more clear to users </li>
                                <li>Differentiated time plurals (e.g. 1 hour vs 2 hours) for places that display time units (Quick Notifications and the Notification Scheduling page). This was harder than expected since android does not seem to support string-array plurals (a string-array where each item is a plurals resource)</li>
                                <li>Added extra padding on the bottom of the app list screen so that the floating action button could not completely cover the bottom right app in the list</li>
                                <li>Updates the default repeat interval from 1 minute to 1 hour</li>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>2.1.1</b>
                                <br>January 19, 2019
                                <li>Fixes crash experienced below Android 7.1 caused by the ShortcutManager class not being able to be found</li>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>2.1.0</b>
                                <br>December 18, 2018
                                <li>Adds Quick Notifications which allows users to create relative-type notifications over and over again with a single tap.</li>
                                <li>For Android 7.1 and above, this update also adds app shortcuts so that users can create frequently used notifications from the Android home screen. For these, the 3 most used shortcuts are displayed when long-pressing the Notification Launcher app but the number that can be pinned is unrestricted (pinned means dragging the shortcut to the home screen). Deleting the Quick Notifications from the app does not delete pinned notifications, so users can create, pin, then delete the quick notification in-app if they would like.
                                <li>Fixes issues causing the tutorial list to reload too often.</li>
                                <li>Fixes a crash that sometimes happens when scheduling shared notifications with no link in the message text.</li>
                                <li>Fixes issue with editing shared notification causing shared link to no longer work.</li>
                                <br>

                                <br>November 13, 2018

                                <li>Added dark theme.</li>
                                <li>Added settings menu.</li>

                                <li>Added a way to notify users if for some reason a notification could not be delivered that shows to the user when re-entering the app at a later time asking them to reschedule or delete their old, unsent notifications.</li>
