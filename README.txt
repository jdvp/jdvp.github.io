Personal Website
	All content and images created by JD Porterfield.
		Updates from time to time to reflect change of interests, new projects, etc.
		
	Template used currently but might create my own in the future.
		Nor sure whether I want to angularize the whole thing, etc.
		Will work on this over Winter Break 2015
