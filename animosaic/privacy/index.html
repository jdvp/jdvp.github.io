            <h1>Animosaic Privacy Policy</h1>
            <h4>Effective: January 24, 2020</h4>
            <p>
                It is Animosaic's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
                website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://jdvp.me/animosaic">https://jdvp.me/animosaic</a>
                (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://jdvp.me/animosaic"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
                personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
                ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and
                under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
                information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of
                information from other sources.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy sets forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your
                activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
            </p>
            <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
            <p>
                Like most website operators, Animosaic collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
                browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
                and the date and time of each visitor request. Animosaic's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
                information is to better understand how Animosaic's visitors use its website. From time to time, Animosaic may
                release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
                usage of its website.
            </p>
            <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>
                We do not collect information entered by visitors. For example, since all of the image processing is done in the
                visitor's browser, neither uploaded images nor entered queries are ever related to us in any capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further, only publicly accessible information from MyAnimeList is used to create the mosaics.
                However, we do not collect or aggregate this data.
            </p>
            <h3>Advertisements</h3>
            <p>
                Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
                compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other
                things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy
            covers the use of cookies by Animosaic and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
            <h3>Links To External Sites</h3>
            <p>
                Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link,
                you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms
                and conditions of every site you visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
                third party sites, products or services.
            </p>
            <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
            <p>
                Animosaic may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website using Google Analytics.
                Animosaic may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
                However, Animosaic does not disclose your personally-identifying information.
            </p>
            <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Although most changes are likely to be minor, Animosaic may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in
                Animosaic's sole discretion. Animosaic encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
                Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
                acceptance of such change.
            </p>
